# Steps:

### Backend should be opened in test mode with: 'npm run start:test'

### Open frontend project: npm start

### In frontend project directory, open Cyress test with: 'npm run cypress:open' OR 'sudo npm run cypress:open' (if the former one could not work)

#### Keep in mind that you have to install and edit your package.json to set up the Cypress test environment first(both in your frontend and backend)

##### Follow the Cypress test steps to test your project
